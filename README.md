# CS61A Spring 2025 Projects

This repository contains my solutions and implementations for **CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (Spring 2025)** at UC Berkeley.

## üìå Course Overview
CS61A is an introduction to computer science that focuses on abstraction, recursion, and functional programming. Topics covered include:
- **Python Programming** (Procedural, Object-Oriented, and Functional Paradigms)
- **Recursion and Tree Recursion**
- **Higher-Order Functions**
- **Data Abstraction & Object-Oriented Programming**
- **Scheme (Lisp Dialect)**
- **SQL & Declarative Programming**
- **Concurrency & Interpreters**

## üìÅ Project Structure
The repository includes various assignments, projects, and exercises:

- `hw/`: Homework assignments covering course topics.
- `labs/`: Lab exercises for hands-on coding practice.
- `projects/`:
  - `hog/`: A probability-based dice game implementation.
  - `cats/`: A typing speed game using functional programming.
  - `ants/`: A tower defense game demonstrating OOP concepts.
  - `scheme/`: Implementation of an interpreter for the Scheme programming language.
  - `hog_contest/`: Contest-based strategies for the Hog game.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Requirements
